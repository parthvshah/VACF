# VACF
Serial and parallel implementation of Velocity Auto-Correlation Function

## Naming
```par1.c``` - Correlation decomposition
```par2.c``` - Correlation decomposition and particle decomposition (experimental)
```par1.1.c``` - Correlation decomposition, load balancing
```par1.3.c``` - Particle decomposition
```par1.3.1.c``` - Particle decomposition, lesser communication
```parOpenMP.c``` - OpenMP implementation, correlation decomposition
```seq.c``` - Sequential implementation
